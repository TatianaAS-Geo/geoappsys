'firelook' is  an application that uses NASA satellite data to facilitate the monitoring of forest active fires, enabling environmental authorities and the general public to have up-to-date information and access precise data for early warnings and the mitigation of these phenomena.

Furthermore, we provide communities with a tool to quickly and effectively report small fires in their territories, promoting environmental conservation and cooperation with government control agencies.
